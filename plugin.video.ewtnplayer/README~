This is my first attempt at this kind of stuff and is really just for
my own learning.  I am not a developer/programmer and I have just 
started to learn python.  Also I have never used Git until today.
This repo is all about creating an XBMC addon.  The code started out
from a tutorial at:
 http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=How-to:Write_plugins_for_XBMC
This EWTN-Player addon scrapes some YouTube EWTN channels to play
within XBMC.
